## Code blocks using backticks

You can use three or more backticks (or tildes) to denote code blocks.
The following markup:

~~~
```
This is a code block.
   White space gets preserved.
   
   function testCodeBlock() {
     // do something here
   }
```
~~~

renders as:

```
This is a code block.
   White space gets preserved.
   
   function testCodeBlock() {
     // do something here
   }
```

## Displaying literal code blocks

If you want to display backticks (or tildes), use the other to start and end the code block:

Here's a code block that displays code block markup:

~~~
```
  some;
    code;
      here;
```
~~~

This is the markup for the code block above (we had to use four backticks to start and end this one):

````
~~~
```
  some;
    code;
      here;
```
~~~
````

## Language syntax highlighting

You can also do language syntax highlighting with backtick code blocks.
Language support and abbreviations vary across platforms, but `java`, `c`, `python`,
and `go` are usually valid. Just add the language immediately after the opening ticks.
For example, <code>```go</code>:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	  fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

Or <code>```java</code>:


```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
```
